# SatellitesOrbitingEarth

[The Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org) maintain a database of the satellites currently oribiting our planet Earth.

In this repository, I scrape [this webpage](http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear-weapons/space-weapons/satellite-database.html) and download the most up to date excel file containing the most up to date list of satellites orbiting the planet.

Now, I have plans to use this data for basic visualizations and other data analytics. Possible some machine learning/data analytics, but I would like to visualize the data so that there is easy access to see the current satellites orbiting the Earth.
