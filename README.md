# SatellitesOrbitingEarth

The Union of Concerned Satellited (http://www.ucsusa.org) maintain a database of the satellites currently oribiting our planet Earth.

In this repository, I scrape this webpage and download the most up to date excel file containing the most up to date list of satellited orbiting the planet.

Now, I have plans to use this data for basic visualizations and other data analytics. This is a work in progress.
